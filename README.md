## General Information

This is my updated portfolio. It’s important because it provides a place to not only list my experience, but to show my experience and contextualize it in greater detail than a resume with bullet points would allow. As I gain experience, learn new skills, and create new projects, my portfolio will be growing with me. 

The new features added are:
* Downloadable resume - A button was added in the About section that opens a pdf version on my resume in a new window.
* A skills section - A skills section was added to showcase the technology and frameworks that I have learnt and implemented.

## Technology

This is a simple portfolio using:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Boostrap CDN - including jQuery plugin.
